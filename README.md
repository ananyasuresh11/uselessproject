Project Description
The Annoying Alarm Clock is a creative and playful tech project designed to make waking up impossible to ignore. Unlike traditional alarm clocks that can be snoozed with a single tap, this clock fights back — using a combination of loud noises, logic puzzles, movement, and even social embarrassment.

The Problem 
Many people set multiple alarms, hit snooze without thinking, or even sleep through loud alarms — defeating the whole purpose of waking up on time. It’s ridiculous how creative people are in avoiding waking up, so we got creative too.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We tackled the unbelievably common problem of 'conscious-sleeping' — where your brain knows how to dismiss an alarm in zombie mode.

User sets the alarm
Selects time, challenge type (puzzle, tap, shake), and optional prank settings.
Alarm time is reached
A loud sound starts playing automatically.
Random challenge is triggered
User must solve a task (e.g., math problem, tap moving button) to stop the alarm.
Alarm reacts based on user response
If solved: Alarm stops and success message shows.
If ignored or wrong: Alarm gets louder or triggers optional punishments (like sending a message).
Data is logged in the backend
Tracks alarm time, response time, and user behavior for future use or insights.
